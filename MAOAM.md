# MAOAM: Mostly Automated Ordering of Amazing Meals

## Overview
MAOAM's job is to reduce the effort required to order a meal at a UofM dining hall.

This project is named after the candy brand MAOAM and their yummy "[Kracher](https://www.haribo.com/de-de/produkte/maoam/kracher)" candy.

## Program Architecture
MAOAM is built using the [Selenium Python Package](https://www.selenium.dev/). Selenium effectively lets a program click around on a website in the same manner that a human user can. This lets MAOAM interact with M-Dining's websites, despite their lack of APIs.
